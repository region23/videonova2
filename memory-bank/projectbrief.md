# VideoNova Project Brief

## Project Overview
VideoNova is a cross-platform desktop application designed to download, translate, and dub videos from platforms like YouTube. The application enables users to transform videos into their preferred language with synchronized dubbed audio.

## Core Requirements

1. **Video Processing Pipeline**
   - Download videos from YouTube and other platforms
   - Extract or recognize speech from videos
   - Translate text to target language
   - Generate synthesized speech from translated text
   - Merge translated audio with the original video

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Both online (OpenAI) and offline processing capabilities
   - User-friendly interface with progress tracking
   - Support for various video sources
   - Automatic management of dependencies (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, etc.)

3. **User Experience**
   - Simple, intuitive workflow
   - Detailed progress reporting
   - Persistent settings and preferences
   - Automatic handling of dependencies
   - Error handling with clear user feedback

## Project Scope
The application will use Electron for the desktop framework, React+TypeScript for the frontend, and Node.js for backend processing. It will integrate with various third-party tools and APIs, including OpenAI services, with fallback to local models for offline operation.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional desktop application
- Installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Self-contained application that manages its dependencies
