   - Create processing history and result management
   - Develop UI for interim results inspection
   - Add file management features

## Roadmap Status

| Phase | Description | Status | Progress |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 0 | Project Initialization | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| 1 | Backend Integration | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| 2 | Frontend Basic UI | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| 3 | Core Processing Pipeline | 🔄 In Progress | 0% |
| 4 | Frontend Progress & UI/UX | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |
| 5 | Offline Mode & Dependencies | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |
| 6 | Error Handling & Optimization | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |
| 7 | First Launch & Finalization | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |

## Known Issues
- Basic UI does not yet provide detailed progress on individual processing steps
- Error handling for failed processing is minimal
- No ability to cancel ongoing processing tasks

## Technical Debt
- The process pipeline needs a coordinator service to manage the workflow
- Error handling is currently minimal in the UI
- Additional automated tests should be added for the UI components
