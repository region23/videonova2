# Project Progress

## Current Status
The project has completed the initial setup phase (Phase 0) and is now moving into the backend integration phase (Phase 1).

## What's Complete
- ✅ Project requirements and specifications defined
- ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan created
- ✅ Technology stack selection
- ✅ Architecture design decisions
- ✅ Processing pipeline workflow definition
- ✅ Memory bank documentation structure established
- ✅ Project initialization (Phase 0)
  - ✅ Project structure with Vite + React + TypeScript
  - ✅ Electron integration with contextIsolation
  - ✅ Typed IPC communication
  - ✅ Ant Design UI framework integration
  - ✅ Dev workflow (ESLint/Prettier)
  - ✅ Settings persistence with electron-store

## What's In Progress
- 🔄 Backend integration (Phase 1)
  - 🔄 Strategy for external CLI dependencies
  - 🔄 Creating wrapper services for external tools

## What's Next
1. **Phase 1: Backend Integration**
   - Create wrapper modules for external tools (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, etc.)
   - Set up AI service clients (OpenAI API)
   - Define interfaces for processing services
   - Integrate through IPC

2. **Phase 2: Frontend Basic UI**
   - Implement project creation/management
   - Create video import/preview functionality
   - Develop basic settings UI
