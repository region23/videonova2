# Active Context

## Current Phase
According to the implementation plan, we have completed **Phase 2: Basic UI Components** and are now moving to **Phase 3: Core Processing Pipeline**.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   - Electron as the desktop application framework
   - React + TypeScript for the frontend
   - Node.js for backend processing
   - Vite for build tooling
   - Ant Design for UI components

2. **Architecture Approach**:
   - Main process (Node.js) will handle media processing and external tools
   - Renderer process (React) will provide user interface
   - IPC for communication between processes
   - Wrapper modules for external dependencies

3. **Processing Pipeline Design**:
   - Sequential processing steps with progress reporting
   - Separation of concerns through modular design
   - Support for both online and offline processing
   - Caching of intermediate results

4. **UI Implementation Decisions**:
   - Form-based input for video URL and language settings
   - Modal dialog for API key management
   - Settings page for theme and window size preferences
   - Centralized status and progress display
   - File selection using native dialog

## Current Focus

The current focus has shifted to **Core Processing Pipeline** (Phase 3):

1. Connect the backend services into a unified processing pipeline
2. Implement job management and queuing
3. Create progress tracking and reporting
4. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Optimize resource usage during processing

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps according to the plan are:

1. **Implement Step 3.1**: Create processing pipeline coordinator in main process
2. **Implement Step 3.2**: Develop job queue management
3. **Implement Step 3.3**: Establish robust progress reporting to UI
4. **Implement Step 3.4**: Add logging and checkpointing
5. **Implement Step 3.5**: Create recovery mechanisms for interrupted processes

## Active Considerations

1. **User Experience**:
   - Detailed progress indication for long-running operations
   - Handling errors and notifying users
   - Allowing cancelation of processes
   - Supporting pause/resume functionality if possible

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Handling large media files efficiently
   - Managing memory usage during processing
   - Balancing CPU usage for simultaneous operations
   - Disk space monitoring for intermediate outputs

3. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Transaction-like approach to ensure all steps complete or roll back
   - Intermediate file management and cleanup
   - Proper error propagation between steps
   - Timeouts and handling slow operations
