# Active Context

## Current Phase
According to the implementation plan, we have completed **Phase 1: Backend Integration** and are now moving to **Phase 2: Basic UI Components**.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   - Electron as the desktop application framework
   - React + TypeScript for the frontend
   - Node.js for backend processing
   - Vite for build tooling
   - Ant Design for UI components

2. **Architecture Approach**:
   - Main process (Node.js) will handle media processing and external tools
   - Renderer process (React) will provide user interface
   - IPC for communication between processes
   - Wrapper modules for external dependencies

3. **Processing Pipeline Design**:
   - Sequential processing steps with progress reporting
   - Separation of concerns through modular design
   - Support for both online and offline processing
   - Caching of intermediate results

4. **Backend Integration Implementation**:
   - Successfully implemented wrapper services for external tools
   - Created interface-based design for all processing steps
   - Established secure IPC communication between frontend and backend
   - Set up dependency management for external tools

## Current Focus

The current focus has shifted to **Frontend Basic UI** (Phase 2):

1. Design and implement the main application layout and navigation
2. Create project management interface (create/open/save)
3. Develop video import and preview functionality
4. Implement basic settings UI for API keys and preferences
5. Build transcription and translation editor interfaces

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps according to the plan are:

1. **Implement Step 2.1**: Create main application layout with navigation
2. **Implement Step 2.2**: Develop project creation and management
3. **Implement Step 2.3**: Build video import and preview components
4. **Implement Step 2.4**: Create settings interface
5. **Implement Step 2.5**: Develop transcription editor
6. **Implement Step 2.6**: Build translation editor
7. **Implement Step 2.7**: Create voice selection interface

## Active Considerations

1. **User Experience**:
   - Intuitive workflow for video processing tasks
   - Clear progress indication for long-running operations
   - Responsive UI that doesn't block during processing
   - Consistent design language using Ant Design components

2. **Project Management**:
   - Project file format and structure
   - Saving and loading project state
   - Managing media assets within projects
   - Version compatibility

3. **Media Handling**:
   - Efficient video preview mechanisms
   - Audio visualization for transcription editing
   - Media player controls and synchronization
   - Handling large media files efficiently

4. **Editor Functionality**:
   - Word-level editing for transcriptions
   - Segment-based translation workflow
   - Time synchronization between video and text
   - Voice and language selection interfaces
