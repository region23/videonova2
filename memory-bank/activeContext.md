# Active Context

## Current Phase
According to the implementation plan, we have completed **Phase 0: Initialization** and are now moving to **Phase 1: Backend Integration**.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   - Electron as the desktop application framework
   - React + TypeScript for the frontend
   - Node.js for backend processing
   - Vite for build tooling
   - Ant Design for UI components

2. **Architecture Approach**:
   - Main process (Node.js) will handle media processing and external tools
   - Renderer process (React) will provide user interface
   - IPC for communication between processes
   - Wrapper modules for external dependencies

3. **Processing Pipeline Design**:
   - Sequential processing steps with progress reporting
   - Separation of concerns through modular design
   - Support for both online and offline processing
   - Caching of intermediate results

## Current Focus

The current focus has shifted to **Backend Integration** (Phase 1):

1. Create wrapper modules for external tools (yt-dlp, ffmpeg)
2. Establish integration with online AI services (OpenAI)
3. Define interfaces for processing services
4. Prepare wrappers for audio processing tools (Demucs, Soundtouch)

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps according to the plan are:

1. **Implement Step 1.1**: Define strategy for external CLI dependencies
2. **Implement Step 1.2**: Create yt-dlp wrapper service
3. **Implement Step 1.3**: Create FFmpeg wrapper service
4. **Implement Step 1.4**: Implement online AI service client (OpenAI)
5. **Implement Step 1.5**: Define interfaces for processing services
6. **Implement Step 1.6**: Create placeholder wrappers for Demucs & Soundtouch
7. **Implement Step 1.7**: Expose backend services via IPC

## Active Considerations

1. **External Dependencies**:
   - How to handle installation and packaging of external tools (ffmpeg, yt-dlp)
   - Managing Python dependencies for Demucs and other Python-based tools
   - Cross-platform compatibility for dependencies

2. **API Integration**:
   - Secure storage of API keys
   - Error handling for API calls
   - Rate limiting and quota management

3. **Process Management**:
   - Efficiently handling child processes for CLI tools
   - Progress reporting from long-running processes
   - Error handling and recovery from process failures

4. **Interface Design**:
   - Creating flexible interfaces that support both online and offline implementations
   - Ensuring proper type safety throughout the application
   - Designing for future extensibility
