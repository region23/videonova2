# Active Context

## Current Phase
According to the implementation plan, we are at **Phase 0: Initialization**. The project is in early stages of setup.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   - Electron as the desktop application framework
   - React + TypeScript for the frontend
   - Node.js for backend processing
   - Vite for build tooling
   - Ant Design for UI components

2. **Architecture Approach**:
   - Main process (Node.js) will handle media processing and external tools
   - Renderer process (React) will provide user interface
   - IPC for communication between processes
   - Wrapper modules for external dependencies

3. **Processing Pipeline Design**:
   - Sequential processing steps with progress reporting
   - Separation of concerns through modular design
   - Support for both online and offline processing
   - Caching of intermediate results

## Current Focus

The current focus is on **Project Initialization and Environment Setup** (Phase 0):

1. Create the basic project structure with Vite and React + TypeScript
2. Integrate Electron and configure IPC communication
3. Set up essential dependencies
4. Establish the development environment

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps according to the plan are:

1. **Implement Step 0.1**: Create project structure using Vite with React + TypeScript template
2. **Implement Step 0.2**: Integrate Electron (main process, preload script, IPC setup)
3. **Implement Step 0.3**: Install and configure core dependencies
4. **Implement Step 0.4**: Set up IPC communication between frontend and backend

After completing Phase 0, the project will move to **Phase 1: Backend Integration** focusing on creating wrapper modules for external tools (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, Demucs, Soundtouch) and AI services.

## Active Considerations

1. **Development Workflow**:
   - How to structure the codebase for maintainability
   - How to handle development vs. production environments
   - Testing strategy for the complex processing pipeline

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - How to package external tools with the application
   - Version management for dependencies
   - Handling platform-specific aspects of dependencies

3. **User Experience**:
   - Designing a simple yet powerful UI
   - Providing clear progress feedback
   - Error handling and recovery

4. **Performance**:
   - Ensuring the UI remains responsive during heavy processing
   - Optimizing media processing operations
   - Managing resource usage for AI models
